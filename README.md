# DevOps: Foundations & Lifecycle

## 1. Foundational DevOps Concepts

**What is DevOps?**  
DevOps is a software development philosophy that bridges the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback to accelerate software delivery while maintaining quality and stability.

**Core Principles:**  
- **Collaboration & Shared Ownership:** Teams working together toward a shared goal or objective, all team members share responsibility for the success and stability of the software throughout its lifecycle.  
- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like builds, tests, deployment, and infrastructure configuration.  
- **Continuous Feedback & Improvement:** Monitor and learn from production to drive future cycles. It is an ongoing process of collecting insights from every stage of the software development lifecycle—planning, coding, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

**Planning:** This is a phase in which features, timelines, and a roadmap are defined collaboratively and agilely. 

**Development:** Write code under version control (e.g., Git), focusing on maintainability.

**Building:** The process of compiling and packaging code into executable artifacts, often via CI(continuous integration) tools.

**Testing:** Run automated tests (unit, integration, performance) to validate quality.

**Release:** Prepare builds for production, manage release artifacts and versions.

**Deployment:** Automate delivery to staging and production, often with IaC and container tooling.

**Operations:** Manage and configure production environments; ensure uptime and performance.

**Monitoring:** Collect logs, metrics, and user data to detect issues and guide improvements.
